## What is LeagueReplayTool?

A React + Electron application that interfaces with the League of Legends Replay API. It allows users to add keyframes to the internal game replay system and modify graphic variables such as fog, depth of field, and camera settings to create cinematic replays.
This tool was created because the original League Director lacks an internal-like UI and cannot stay always on top since it doesn’t work as an overlay. LeagueReplayTool solves these issues by providing an always-on-top external UI.
