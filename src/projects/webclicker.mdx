##  Overview  
**webclicker** is a remote control system for a C++ application. It consists of:

- A **C++ TCP client** running on the target machine  
- A **C# TCP server** handling communication  
- A **React + TypeScript** web frontend for sending commands  
- **JWT authentication** to secure access

The web interface sends commands to the server, which forwards them to the C++ client over TCP.

##  Tech Stack  
- **Client:** C++  
- **Server:** .NET + MySQL
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript  + Tailwind
- **Auth:** JWT + HWID based client authentication
- **Hosting:** Coolify (self-hosted)
<br/>
##  What I learned  
- Building TCP communication in both C++ and C#  
- Integrating native code with a web interface
- Securing client-server communication with JWT
- Applying authentication and lightweight DRM concepts to a native C++ desktop app
<br/>
##  What I could improve on the project
- Use WebSockets for communication
- Not send commands in JSON, instead explore options like Protobuf
- Send updates from the C++ desktop app and show them on the dashboard, like errors & status updates.
