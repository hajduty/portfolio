## Try It Out

[ Check out the live demo](soon)

## What is TeamSketch?

TeamSketch is a real-time collaborative whiteboard app designed for brainstorming, diagramming, or just doodling with others — instantly and directly in the browser.  
It started as a simple fullstack app, but has since evolved into being **microservice-based** and focused on scalability and real-time performance.

## Features

- 🧠 Real-time drawing and updates with multiple users  
- ✏️ Basic drawing tools (pen, text, erase, clear canvas)  
- 🔗 Room-based collaboration (shareable links)  
- 💾 Automatic session saving and state recovery  
- ⚡ Optimized real-time communication using **SignalR** and **Redis Pub/Sub**

<br/>

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Konva, Y.js, Zustand 
- **Backend:** .NET 8 microservices using gRPC for inter-service communication  
- **Infrastructure**:  
Redis for backplane and event broadcasting  
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for deployment and scaling  
Azure SQL Database for persistent data storage  
Azure Container Registry (ACR) for container image management  

<br/>

## What I Learned

- Designing and deploying a distributed **microservice architecture**  
- Using **SignalR** with **Redis backplane** for high-performance real-time updates  
- Implementing **gRPC** communication between backend services  
- Managing deployments and scaling with **Azure Kubernetes Service**  
- Structuring code for independent, maintainable, and scalable service boundaries   
<br/>
Is this the best solution for such a simple app? **No.**
I just wanted to learn as many different technologies as possible, and apply them in a *real* project.  

## What’s Next?

- 🎨 Advanced tools (brushes, shapes, layers)  
- 📤 Export to PNG/PDF  
- 📱 Better mobile & tablet support  
- 👥 Improved collaboration features (notes, better role management)

Or maybe I just leave it as is and move on to the next experiment.
