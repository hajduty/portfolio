## What is TeamSketch?

TeamSketch is a real-time collaborative whiteboard app designed for brainstorming, diagramming, or just doodling with others — instantly and directly in the browser.  
It started as a simple fullstack app, but has since evolved into being **microservice** and focused on scalability and real-time performance.

## Features

- 🧠 Real-time drawing and updates with multiple users  
- ✏️ Basic drawing tools (pen, text, erase, clear canvas)  
- 🔗 Room-based collaboration (shareable links)  
- 💾 Automatic session saving and state recovery  
- ⚡ Optimized real-time collaboration using **Yjs**

<br/>

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Konva, Y.js, Zustand 
- **Backend:** .NET 8 microservices using gRPC for inter-service communication  
- **Infrastructure**:  
Redis as backplane and for event broadcasting  
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for deployment and scaling  
Azure SQL Database for storage
Azure Container Registry (ACR) for container image management  
Azure Pipelines & GitHub Actions for CI/CD

<br/>

## What I Learned

- Designing and deploying microservices  
- Using **SignalR**, **Redis** & **Yjs** for high-performance real-time updates  
- Implementing **gRPC** communication between backend services  
- Managing deployments in Azure DevOps
- Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service
<br/>
Is this the best solution for such a simple app? **No.**
I just wanted to learn as many different technologies as possible, and apply them in a *real* project.  

## What’s Next?

- 🎨 Advanced tools (brushes, shapes, layers)  
- 📤 Export to PNG/PDF  
- 📱 Better mobile & tablet support  
- 👥 Improved collaboration features (notes, better role management)

Or maybe I just leave it as is and move on to the next experiment.
