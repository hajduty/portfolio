## What is TeamSketch?

TeamSketch is a real-time collaborative whiteboard app designed for brainstorming, diagramming, or just doodling with others — instantly and directly in the browser.  

## Features

- Real-time drawing and updates with multiple users  
- Room-based collaboration (shareable links)  
- Automatic session saving and state recovery

<br/>

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Konva, Y.js, Zustand 
- **Backend:** .NET 8 microservices using gRPC for inter-service communication  
- **Infrastructure**:  
Redis for backplane and event broadcasting  
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for deployment and scaling  
Azure SQL Database for persistent data storage  
Azure Container Registry (ACR) for container image management  

<br/>

## What I Learned

- Designing and deploying a distributed **microservice architecture**  
- Using **SignalR** with **Redis backplane** for high-performance real-time updates  
- Implementing **gRPC** communication between backend services  
- Managing deployments in Azure DevOps
- Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service
- To stick to stateless monoliths
<br/>

Is this the best setup for such a simple app? **No**
Would it make sense if it had real users? **Maybe**

The goal was simply to learn and experiment with different technologies in a real project.
Using a microservice architecture for an app this small just makes development and deployment more complicated.

## What’s Next?

- 🎨 Advanced tools (brushes, shapes, layers)  
- 📤 Export to PNG/PDF
- 📱 Better mobile & tablet support  
- 👥 Improved collaboration features (notes, better role management)
