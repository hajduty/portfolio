## What is TeamSketch?

TeamSketch is a real-time collaborative whiteboard app designed for brainstorming, diagramming, or just doodling with others, instantly and directly in the browser.  

## Features

- Real-time drawing and updates with multiple users  
- Room-based collaboration (shareable links)  
- Automatic session saving and state recovery

<br/>

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Konva, Y.js, Zustand 
- **Backend:** .NET 8 microservices, gRPC for inter-service communication

<br/>

### Infrastructure

- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration and scaling
- Azure SQL Database for persistent storage
- Redis for SignalR scale-out and internal event broadcasting
- Azure Container Registry (ACR) for container image management

### CI/CD

- GitHub Actions for build and test pipelines
- Azure Pipelines for deployment to AKS

## What I Learned

- Designing and deploying microservices  
- Using **SignalR**, **Redis** & **Yjs** for high-performance real-time updates  
- Implementing **gRPC** communication between backend services  
- Managing deployments in Azure DevOps
- Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service
- To stick to stateless monoliths
<br/>

Is this the best setup for such a simple app? **No**
Would it make sense if it had real users? **Maybe**

The goal was to learn and experiment with different technologies in a real project.
Using a microservice architecture for an app this small just makes development and deployment more complicated.

## What’s Next?

- Advanced tools (brushes, shapes, layers)  
- Export to PNG/PDF
- Better mobile & tablet support  
- Improved collaboration features (notes, better role management)
