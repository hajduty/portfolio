**Date:** June 10, 2025

##  Try It Out

[ Check out the live demo](soon)

[ View the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hajduty/teamsketch)

##  What is TeamSketch?

TeamSketch is a real-time collaborative whiteboard app I built for fun. The idea came from wanting a simple place where I (and anyone else) could sketch out ideas, flowcharts, or doodles *together*, without needing to install anything.

## Features

-  Real-time drawing with multiple users
-  Basic drawing tools (pen, text, clear canvas)
-  Easy room system (join by link)
-  Auto-saving your sketch

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Konva + Y.js  
- **Backend**: .NET + MongoDB + YDotNet  
- **Hosting**: Self-hosted Coolify instance
<br/>
##  What I Learned

- How to manage real-time syncing across clients with Y.js
- Handling performance issues with thousands of tiny draw events
- Building something that’s fun to *use*, not just *make*
<br/>

##  What’s Next?
Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. Some ideas I might explore later:

- Adding different brush types
- Exporting to PNG/PDF
- Optimizing for mobile & tablets

Or maybe I just leave it as is and start another random project.
