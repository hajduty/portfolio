# Overview
EasyCourse is a full-stack web platform for creating, browsing, and interacting with educational course content.

The system is built as a client–server application where a React frontend consumes an ASP.NET Core Web API. 

## Tech Stack
 - **Backend**: .NET 8 API
 - **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TanStack Query, TailwindCSS, shadcn
 - **Database**: MySQL (SQL Server doesn't work on ARM cpus)
 - **Storage**: MinIO (s3)
 - **Hosting**: Hetzner, Docker, Coolify

<br/>

## What I could improve
The backend currently follows a layered architecture, and the number of interfaces, repositories, and service layers has started to hurt developer experience. 
For future features, gradually moving toward a vertical slice architecture would likely improve development speed and reduce the mental overhead of jumping between layers.

## Planned features

* I plan to add a code sandbox, so users can add LeetCode style programming problems to their courses alongside the existing quizzes.
* AI Agents that create educational content, aswell as comment and give feedback to existing courses.
* Give users access to the AI to generate learning content, currently all available content was generated through an AI agent using Grok.
