# Overview
EasyCourse is a full-stack web platform for creating, browsing, and interacting with educational course content.

The system is built as a client–server application where a React frontend consumes an ASP.NET Core Web API. 
The backend handles application logic, persistence, and media management, while the frontend focuses on presentation and interaction.

## Tech Stack
 - **Backend**: .NET 8 API
 - **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
 - **Database**: MySQL (SQL Server doesn't work on ARM cpus)
 - **Storage**: MinIO (s3 object storage)
 - **Hosting**: Hetzner, Docker, Coolify

<br/>
## What I could improve
The backend currently follows a layered architecture, and the number of interfaces, repositories, and service layers has started to hurt development experience. 
For future features, gradually moving toward a vertical slice architecture would likely improve development speed and reduce the mental overhead of jumping between layers.

## What I learned

## Planned features

* I plan to add a code sandbox, so users can add LeetCode style programming problems to their courses alongside the existing quizzes.
* AI Agents that create educational content, aswell as comment and give feedback to existing courses.
